## Overview

Movie Explorer is a React-based web application that allows users to explore movies and TV shows. The app fetches movie and TV data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, and provides features like viewing popular movies, airing-now TV shows, and adding movies to a personal favorites list. Users can navigate through the app using keyboard shortcuts, and the app stores favorites in localStorage for persistence.

## Features

- **Explore Movies and TV Shows**: Browse popular movies and TV shows airing today.
- **Favorites List**: Add/remove movies from your favorites list. Favorites are stored in localStorage to persist across sessions.
- **Keyboard Navigation**: The app supports keyboard navigation, allowing users to browse movies and pages with arrow keys, select a movie with the Enter key, and reset selection with the Escape key.
- **Pagination**: Navigate through movie listings with previous/next buttons.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across devices with a responsive layout.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: Frontend framework for building the user interface.
- **Axios**: HTTP client for making API requests to TMDb.
- **TMDb API**: The Movie Database API to fetch movie and TV show data.
- **CSS**: Custom styles for the app layout.

## API Integration

The app uses the [TMDb API](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api) to fetch movie and TV show data. You can get your own API key from TMDb by registering an account and creating an API key.

To integrate your own API key:

1. Replace the current API key in the code with your own key (found in the `Authorization` header inside `PopularMovies.js`).
